## What is DLX?

DLX is a cli tool for LXD to quickly provision opinionated development environments on your own hardware. You provide a LXD server and DLX does the rest, rapidly provisioning new development environments for you.

DLX is especially delightful if you install it on a spare computer or laptop that you aren't currently using.

### Components

DLX has two components:

* **DLX** - The cli tool that interacts with the server.
* An **LXD** server. This is the server that DLX will use to provision new development environments.
