# TODO

## Provisioning and Assumptions

* make baseimage fixed dlxbase-profile -- dlxbase-default, dlxbase-service, dlxbase-pets

* add base.yaml to client install. Allow client to edit and upload

* add command to upload & rebuild base image(s)

* Terraform linux provider for initial setup?
* bicep provisioning!

* Tailscale PAT passed through to container for tailscale up


* Note about LXD_CONF when snap lxc is installed, but running dlx on linux - symlink from snap config to .config/lxc
